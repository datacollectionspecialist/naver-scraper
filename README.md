### Step 3: Set crawling parameters
Product ID and Store ID can be found directly in the product URL. Let’s take a look: [[바르닭] 닭і슴살 143종 크런치 소품닭 닭스테ց 소스큐브 골라담기 [원산지:국산(경기도 포천시) 등]](https://brand.naver.com/barudak/products/4469033180?NaPm=ct%3Dm9mo5x4g%7Cci%3D800b828f830f1d3d81df0575f6009efc9235fd9a%7Ctr%3Dnshsnx%7Csn%3D727239%7Cic%3D%7Chk%3De39ed35e26996b18c35ced568d18f83bc39fdf94) Take this as an example:

> Store ID: barudak
>
> Product number: 4469033180

### Step 4: Capture basic product information
After setting the necessary capture parameters, click "Start Capture" and the capture results will be displayed on the right.

Here are some example crawl results:

```language

### Step 5: Crawl Naver product coupon information
From the above crawl results, we can see the following information:

In addition, you can also find other unique identifiers related to products, such as:
>
> "productId": "10217226674"
